# Computer-Vision-Assignments

Assignment -1
A. Perform histogram equalization of a gray scale image.

B. Perform image smoothing using Gaussian filtering.

C. Apply median filtering to remove noise from given image. Week2_Q3_image.tif  

Assignment -2
A. Given the image “HM.jpg” (small squares correspond to pixels). Find white pixels, that do not have 4-connected neighboring pixels.

Hint: Perform Hit-or-Miss transform. Create image matrix similar to HM.jpg and then process.

 

B. Given “lena_RGB.tif” image. Perform Prewitt, Sobel and Canny edge Detection. Compare the results.

 

C. Perform Laplacian to sharpen the “moon.tif” image.

Assignment-3
Given the image “strawberries.tif”. Process the image and show only edible part of strawberry.
Given the image ‘polygon.png’, find all the polygons in the image, and for each polygon detect the number and location of vertices (corners). Given notebook ‘week5-B.ipynb’. Note: You need to apply cv2.connectedComponents twice: once for separating each shape, and once for detecting the corners of each shape. Change the parameter window_size (and possibly other parameters) in the Harris corner detector until you get the correct result.
